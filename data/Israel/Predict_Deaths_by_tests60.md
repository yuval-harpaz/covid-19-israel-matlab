## Predict deaths by positive tests for over 60y old
The tests by age is downloaded from [here](https://data.gov.il/dataset/covid-19/resource/d337959a-020a-4ed3-84f7-fca182292308). Since this is heavy, millions of lines, I save daily summaries in  [tests.csv](https://github.com/yuval-harpaz/covid-19-israel-matlab/blob/master/data/Israel/tests.csv). The dashboard data for the deceased is shorter, but has no GUI to download it. I get it with curl and put it here [dashboard_timeseries.csv](https://github.com/yuval-harpaz/covid-19-israel-matlab/blob/master/data/Israel/dashboard_timeseries.csv). I also use aprobability vector, which is a normalized histogram for the days it took from recieving a positive result to death. It is saved in [positive_to_death.txt](https://github.com/yuval-harpaz/covid-19-israel-matlab/blob/master/data/Israel/positive_to_death.txt), and can be computed from [this resource](https://data.gov.il/dataset/covid-19/resource/a2b2fceb-3334-44eb-b7b5-9327a573ea2c).
